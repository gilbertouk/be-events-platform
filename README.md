<h1 align="center">Welcome to Events Platform Back-End üëã</h1>

<p>
This RESTful API was designed to provide essential functionalities for a platform where businesses can share their events with community members, allowing members to sign up and optionally make payments to participate in the events.</p>
<p>The technologies used in development include Express.js to handle API routes and business logic, Prisma for database interactions, Firebase Admin for authentication and other Firebase functionalities, Stripe for payment processing, Cloudinary for image manipulation, and Zod for data validation.</p>
<p>With this API, developers can create both a website and a mobile application to provide a user-friendly interface, enabling users to view events, sign up, and make payments securely and efficiently.</p>
